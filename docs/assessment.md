# Assessment

This unit is worth 20 credit points, which is 1/6 of your first year. Your first year does not count towards your degree classification, but you do need to pass it to progress to 2nd year.

This unit will be assessed by a single 3-hour exam held in an exam hall in the January 2023 assessment period from 9-20 January 2023. You must be in Bristol for this entire period, and your exact exam date and time will be published in your exam timetable closer to the date.

You get awarded credit for this unit, which you need to progress to 2nd year, if you get a mark of at least 40% on the exam and you meet the attendance hurdle of 15/20 workshops.

## Exam Format

You may bring a calculator that meets university regulations to the exam. You may not bring any notes, books, or other electronic devices. You must bring a pencil and an eraser for the anwer sheet. You may use further, empty sheets of paper for calculations, but these will not be marked.

The exam will use a format that I call "rapidmark" in which you write your answers in pencil in boxes on a pre-printed answer sheet. Question formats could include, among others:

  - True/False
  - Multiple choice
  - Mark all that apply
  - Enter one or more numbers in boxes
  - Place crosses in a table (for example, complete a truth table for a circuit)
  - Draw some lines/arrows in a graph

Rapidmark means that to mark your exam, I will scan all answer sheets, code up some image recognition to automatically mark most of your exam (for example, detect whether you put a cross in the "true" or "false" box for one question), then mark the remaining question(s) by hand. _I will also visually check every single answer sheet myself, so you do not need to be worried about mistakes in the image recognition._

This is not only much quicker to mark than a traditional exam, but it is also more objective and fairer in some respects, and it gives me detailed statistics to see how well students did on each topic at no extra cost.

For you as a student, rapidmark means:

  - There will not be questions where you are asked to write full English sentences or proofs, or to "show your workings". Indeed there is no way to get any partial marks for workings: your answer to a question is either correct, or incorrect.
  - You must strictly follow the rules for filling in answer sheets, for example putting crosses or digits completely within the required boxes, and using pencil/eraser only.

During the unit, there will be four separate class tests where you will be able to practice the rapidmark format and I will use these to ensure the software is properly designed and calibrated for the exam itself. The class tests do not count towards your unit grade, but completing them does count towards your attendance hurdle.
