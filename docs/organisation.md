# Unit Organisation

## Prerequisites

We require an A* grade in mathematics at A-levels, or an equivalent qualification, to join the Computer Science degree. You have chosen to enrol in one of the better universities in the country and that means we trust you are able to identify by yourself where you have gaps in your previous knowledge, and to deal with this for example by independently teaching yourself missing topics with the help of books in the library or online resources - there are free videos online on every part of A-level mathematics.

## Communication and Scalability

In 2022-23, we are expecting up to 200 students, and this unit is taught by a single lecturer. This has some consequences for how we work together to keep everything running smoothly:

  - Your main sources of support will be the scheduled workshops and support sessions. You should turn up to these hours, and you **must not** expect immediate help at any other time.
  - Questions outside the scheduled hours **must** go on the Microsoft Teams forum. We will answer them as soon as resonably possible **during working hours**. (You may post a question on Teams at 11pm on a weekend if you want to, but you will not get an answer until 9am next Monday at the earliest.)
  - You **must not** e-mail, phone, or private message the lecturer individually with questions about the material: this does not scale, and is unfair to other students. Instead, you must ask in the official forum, where we can reply once and then all students can see the same information.
  - You **will not** get extra private lessons from the lecturer or the TAs, please do not ask for this. _If you are a disabled student, there may be extra support available for you through disability services and you should check with them, not your lecturer, about this._

## Schedule

In 2022-23, this unit will run in-person/on-campus only, but with new material delivered via videos instead of traditional lectures.

Each teaching week is divided into two blocks. For each block, you will:

  1. Watch the videos and read any supporting materials in your own time, before the workshop.
  2. Attend the workshop at the indicated time and solve a problem sheet in a group with other students.
  3. After the workshop, revise the material by yourself or with friends.
  4. Optionally, come to the support sessions where a lecturer or TAs will be around to answer your questions.
  5. Optionally, ask or answer questions on the unit's Microsoft Teams online forums.

See the [unit materials](materials.html) page for the topics and materials for each block.

All in-person activities will take place in room MVB 1.11 - one floor down from the entrance to our building. We have both parts of the room booked for this unit, and for the workshops, tables will be set out for you to work in groups.

The in-person activities are:

  - Monday, 1pm-3pm: Workshop 1 (mandatory)
  - Tuesday, 4pm-5pm: Support Session 1 (optional)
  - Thursday, 9am-11am: Workshop 2 (mandatory)
  - Thursday, 1pm - 2pm: Support Session 2 (optional)

Week 6 (31 October - 4 November) is reading week; all your units pause for this week and there are no scheduled activities.

Week 12 (12 December - 16 December) is revision week; there is no new material, and the workshops are replaced with 2-hour support sessions, and the one-hour support sessions are cancelled.

See the [workshops page](workshops.html) for more information on the workshops.

## Support Sessions

The Tuesday 4-5pm and Friday 1-2pm slots are our support sessions. We will use these however is most useful at the time, and I am happy to take student input and feedback on what you find most useful.

The support sessions take the place of "office hours" on this unit; due to the large number of students, they are held in the same room as your workshops instead of an office.

Support sessions are not mandatory to attend, and do not count towards your attendance and cannot be used to make up for a missed workshop.

I imagine that the support sessions will be a mix of lecture, problem class, drop-in, office hour, Q&A and other things. Some days I may present some of the material again or solve worked examples; other days the whole session will be spent answering questions from students - but there will always be time for you to ask me questions during these sessions.

The support sessions and workshops will not be recorded.

## Class Tests

In some weeks, a workshop will be replaced with a class test. The marks from these do not count towards your unit mark, they are purely for you to be able to assess your own progress on the unit. Completing them and handing in your answer sheets is mandatory, but failing them has no consequences (beyond encouraging you to improve on the next one). The class tests are your main practice opportunities for the final exam.

## Technology

This unit, like most of the university, runs on the Microsoft technology stack. Your videos will normally be hosted in Microsoft Streams and you will be able to access them with your Microsoft Single Sign-On and watch them in a web browser.

Files, such as lecture notes, problem sheets and solutions, will be hosted on a filestore (technically a "Microsoft 365 group") that you can access either via links on this page or via Microsoft Teams. As an enrolled student, the group for this unit will show up automatically once the unit has started when you open Teams.

For online questions and answers, we will use Microsoft Teams as a forum.

## Time Planning

As a rough guide to time planning:

  1. The average student should spend around 40 hours a week on average on work related to their course. If you are regularly spending much longer than that in first year and not getting the results you expect, you might want to seek advice on effective learning strategies at university. 
  2. In your first teaching block, you have three units each worth 20 credits. This means on average you will spend 13 hours per week on each unit (assuming a 39-hour week), that is a bit more than a day and a half a week per unit - although in practice most students will have units that take them shorter or longer than others.
  3. The timetabled hours - in this unit the workshops and support sessions, in others maybe labs or problem classes - take up much less time than the 13 hours you are supposed to spend on the unit. We have 6 hours per week timetabled, that leaves another 7 hours per week on average for you to organise in your own time for watching videos, reading notes, revising problems etc.

It might be a good idea to make your own personal timetable where you allocate fixed self-study hours for each unit beyond the timetabled sessions.
