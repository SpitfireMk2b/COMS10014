# Unit organisation

## Prerequisites

We require an A* grade in mathematics at A-levels, or an equivalent qualification, to join the Computer Science degree. Obviously, A-levels have been disrupted this year but that does not mean we are going to make you leave with a less valuable degree in three to four years time by "dumbing down" the content of your degree. You have chosen to enrol in one of the better universities in the country and that means we trust you are able to identify by yourself where you have gaps in your previous knowledge, and to deal with this for example by independently teaching yourself missing topics with the help of books in the library or online resources - there are free videos online on every part of A-level mathematics.

## Activities

Each week, you will complete two _activities_, in which you will

  * Prepare yourself by studying assigned material in your own time - this will be a combination of videos and written notes. The material will be linked from this website.
  * Attend a workshop in which you work on a problem sheet, in groups with other students.
  * Revise the material further in your own time.

The timetabled sessions for this unit are:

  * Monday, 1-3pm: workshop 1 (mandatory)
  * Thursday, 10am-12pm: workshop 2 (mandatory)
  * Friday, 10-11am: drop-in session (optional, online only)

Your first workshop will be on Monday 27 September, known as "Week 1" in the university calendar.

Week 6 commencing Monday 1 November is Reading Week; there are no activities and no workshops in this week. Week 12 commencing Monday 13 December is revision week, in this week the workshops are replaced by drop-in sessions and there is no new material.

There are no lectures in the traditional sense on this unit; the delivery of new material is replaced by videos which you watch in your own time before each workshop. It might be a good idea to set aside fixed times each week to watch the videos for each unit. We will try and release all the videos at least one week before the relevant workshop, where possible.

## Technology

This unit, like most of the university, runs on the Microsoft technology stack. Your videos will normally be hosted in Microsoft Streams and you will be able to access them with your university login and watch them in a web browser.

The online versions of the workshops, as well as the drop-ins, will run in a Microsoft Teams group that you will be automatically enrolled in with your university accounts. Teams will also be the place where host the lecture materials (PDFs of slides, lecture notes, worksheets, solutions) although we will link to them from this website. We recommend that you download the desktop version of Teams (free with your university account) but you can also use it from a web browser.

For some parts of the unit, you will use the university's virtual learning environment "blackboard".

## Workshops

The main learning on this unit will happen in the workshops, held twice a week, in which you will work in groups on a problem sheet. Some of the workshops are class tests or mock exams, these to not count towards your unit grade but they will help you to track your progress and prepare for the final exam.

Attending the workshops is mandatory, see the [workshops page](workshops.html) for more information.

The plan for the workshops in 2021-2022 is to hold them on campus where possible, but with a parallel online version for students who are not able to come in person. If for any reason the on-campus workshops become impossible (such as another lockdown), then everyone will attend the online version. If we are required to reduce the number of students in the on-campus workshops (for example to maintain a greater distance between people) then we will introduce a rota system where everyone is told which on-campus workshops they are allowed to attend; for the other workshops you will then attend the online version.

If you cannot attend the on-campus workshop (for example you are self-isolating) then you must attend the online one held in Microsoft Teams and supported by Teaching Assistants; otherwise we recommend that you attend the on-campus on as we can give you better support there. For the online versions of the workshops, you will need an internet connection, a microphone and a web camera. Since writing mathematics on a computer can be hard, you might want to also have a pad of paper and a pen nearby and point your camera at that when you want to show something to a TA.

## Drop-ins

The timetabled hour on Friday morning is a drop-in session. This is optional to attend and there is no worksheet: the idea is that you turn up and ask any questions you have, and TAs and sometimes academic staff will be there to answer them. The drop-in session will be held on Microsoft Teams.

Week 12, the last week of term, is revision week. There is no new material this week and the workshops are replaced by drop-ins, which we plan on holding both on campus and online.

## Time planning

As a rough guide to time planning:

  1. The average student should spend around 40 hours a week on average on work related to their course. If you are regularly spending much longer than that in first year and not getting the results you expect, you might want to seek advice on effective learning strategies at university. 
  2. In your first teaching block, you have three units each worth 20 credits. This means on average you will spend 13 hours per week on each unit (assuming a 39-hour week), that is a bit more than a day and a half a week per unit - although in practice most students will have units that take them shorter or longer than others.
  3. The timetabled hours - in this unit the workshops and drop-ins, in others maybe labs or problem classes - take up much less time than the 13 hours you are supposed to spend on the unit. In a normal year with timetabled lectures, the advice to students was to spend at least as much time again on each unit in self-study as you had contact hours for lectures and labs combined. This year with lectures replaced by videos, your contact time in the workshops and drop-ins will make up an even smaller part of all the work you are expected to do for each unit: for Maths A, 4-5 hours per week out of your budget of 13 are timetabled so that leaves you with 8-9 hours to plan and fill by yourself.

It might be a good idea to make your own timetable where you allocate fixed hours for watching videos, revision, and coursework (on the programming units) on each of your units, as well as the hours that the university has timetabled for you.

## Contacts

Your main ways of getting help with the unit are:

  1. Ask a TA or staff member during the workshops.
  2. Come to a drop-in session.
  3. Post your question on the online forums for the unit (in Teams).
  4. Ask other members of your tutor group, or other students that you know.

On this unit and on all your other 1st year units, you will be in a cohort of over 200 students and at times the unit may be managed by a single member of academic staff. Once you understand this problem of scale, you will also hopefully respect the following rule.

**You must not e-mail or private-message unit staff individually with questions about the unit**. This does not scale. If we answer in an e-mail then that answer only goes to one student and the other students cannot see it, which is unfair; if another student asks the same question later, then we have to write another e-mail which is inefficient.

Instead, you must ask questions in the workshops or drop-ins, or outside these hours on the unit's Teams group, where it takes us the same time to reply but the benefit for students is much greater as everyone can read the same explanation, and we only have to answer once. If you have a question, assume that many other students in the cohort are asking themselves the same thing and will also profit from reading the answer.

The combination of student/staff ratios (which can go over 200) and the pandemic mean that the days when you could turn up and knock on a staff member's office door at any time you like are over. Some staff may not even have an office, or only be on campus on particular days during the week. Questions about this unit must go through the official channels (workshops, drop-ins, Teams) for reasons of both efficiency and fairness.

We do not offer extra private lessons for individual students, neither online nor in person. However, if you are a student with a registered disability, or from a widening participation background, there may be extra support that you can access through the university.

## Assessment and grades

To pass this unit, you must do two things:

  * Attend at least 75% of all workshops (including class tests and mock exams in workshop slots) - see the [workshops page](workshops.html).
  * Attend and pass the exam in January. The pass mark is 40%, and if you achieve this then your unit mark will be your exam mark.
  
The class tests and mock exams in some workshops are formative, that is they are purely for feedback to you and they do not count towards your unit grade. Attending them does count towards your 75% attendance target however, but you get attendance whether you pass the formative tests or not as long as you have demonstrated engagement.
