# Unit organisation

## Prerequisites

We require an A* grade in mathematics at A-levels, or an equivalent qualification, to join the Computer Science degree. Obviously, A-levels have been disrupted this year but that does not mean we are going to make you leave with a less valuable degree in three to four years time by "dumbing down" the content of your degree. You have chosen to enrol in one of the better universities in the country and that means we trust you are able to identify by yourself where you have gaps in your previous knowledge, and to deal with this for example by independently teaching yourself missing topics with the help of books in the library or online resources - there are free videos online on every part of A-level mathematics.

## Activities

Each week, you will complete two _activities_, in which you will

  * Prepare yourself by studying assigned material in your own time - this will be a combination of videos and written notes.
  * Attend an online workshop in which you work on a problem sheet related to a material in groups.
  * Revise the material further in your own time.

The main learning on this unit will happen in the online workshops. Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be around during the workshops to help your group with any questions that you might have. In these workshops, you will work in groups of 12 and you will stay in the same group for the entire unit - a good way to safely socialise with some other students on your course.

The timetabled sessions for this unit are:

  * Tuesday, 2-4pm: workshop 1 (mandatory)
  * Thursday, 2-3pm: drop-in session (optional)
  * Friday, 2-4pm: workshop 2 (mandatory)
  
All the sessions will be held online using Microsoft Teams. This runs both in the browser, or if you want to you can download it as a separate program. Drop-ins are optional sessions where the TAs are active on Teams and you can come in to ask them questions. There will be no in-person (on campus) teaching on this unit.

For the workshops and drop-ins, you will need an internet connection, a microphone and a web camera (most smartphones have a pretty good microphone and camera built in). Since writing mathematics on a computer can be hard, you might want to also have a pad of paper and a pen nearby and point your camera at that when you want to show something to a TA.

**Attending the workshops is mandatory**, and part of the TAs' job will be to help with taking attendance in each workshop. This unit has a hurdle, as specified in the unit catalogue, that you must attend 3/4 (75%) of all workshops otherwise you automatically fail the unit. As you will see below, there are not workshops every week, so make sure you understand which weeks they are taking place or not.

If you miss a workshop, your tutor will be informed and repeated unexcused absences may be noted on your student record and lead to other consequences - a student who almost never engages may be asked to withdraw from the university. If you are unable to attend a workshop for good reason, such as illness, then you must self-certify your absence using the university process for this, **before** the start of the workshop. If you are struggling with the unit or the course for any reason, you must inform your personal tutor as soon as possible. On no account should you stop going to the workshops because you've fallen behind, because that leads to falling further behind and failing the year.

Some of the workshops are in-class tests or mock exams. These are _formative_, which means the results from these tests are not used for your unit mark, but they do help you to understand your own performance on the unit.

## Time planning

As a rough guide to time planning:

  1. The average student should spend just over 40 hours a week on average on work related to their course. If you are regularly spending much longer than that in first year and not getting the results you expect, you might want to seek advice on effective learning strategies at university. 
  2. In your first teaching block, you have three units each worth 20 credits. This means on average you will spend 14 hours per week on each unit (assuming a 42-hour week), that is a bit more than a day and a half a week per unit - although in practice most students will have units that take them shorter or longer than others.
  3. The timetabled _synchronous_ hours - in this unit the workshops and drop-ins, in others maybe labs or problem classes - take up much less time than the 14 hours you are supposed to spend on the unit. In a normal year with timetabled lectures, the advice to students was to spend at least as much time again on each unit in self-study as you had contact hours for lectures and labs combined. This year with lectures replaced by _asynchronous_ material, e.g. you can read or watch it in your own time, your contact time in the workshops and drop-ins will make up only a tiny part of all the work you are expected to do for each unit: for Maths A, 4-5 hours out of 14 per week and even that only in 8 weeks out of 12.

## Contacts

Your main ways of getting help with the unit are:

  1. Ask a TA or staff member during the workshops.
  2. Come to a drop-in session.
  3. Post your question on the online forums for the unit.
  4. Ask other members of your bubble, or other students that you know.

You must not e-mail unit staff individually with questions about the material, as if we answer in an e-mail then that answer only goes to one student and the others cannot see it, which is unfair. Instead of e-mailing, you should ask questions on the unit forum, where it takes us the same time to reply but the benefit for students is much greater as everyone can read the same explanation.

We do not offer extra private lessons for individual students. However, if you are a student with a registered disability, or from a widening participation background, there may be extra support that you can access through the university.

## Assessment and grades

To pass this unit, you must do two things:

  * Attend at least 75% of all workshops (including class tests and mock exams in workshop slots).
  * Attend and pass the exam in January. The pass mark is 40%, and if you achieve this then your unit mark will be your exam mark.
  
Attendance does not count towards your grade, but if you do not meet the 75% attendance target then you automatically fail the unit. TAs will be taking attendance in every workshop and it is important that you turn up on time and switch to the correct online "room" for your group; if you are late to a workshop then you must find a TA and make sure that you are recorded. If you are unwell then you must submit a [self-certification for absence form (use the "Engineering Student Forms" link)](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/current-students/) _before the workshop starts_, in which case it will count as attended. If you are unwell for longer than a week, you should see a doctor and get a doctor's note. Since the workshops are online, you are expected to attend even if you are self-isolating or in quarantine, if you are well enough to do so.

The class tests and mock exams in some workshops are formative, that is they are purely for feedback to you and they do not count towards your unit grade. Attending them does count towards your 75% attendance target however.

Drop-in sessions and optional slots in weeks where there are no workshops (marked -- on the [schedule](materials.md)) are not mandatory and cannot be used to count towards your attendance target. These slots will only be staffed if we have enough TA budget to hold them.
