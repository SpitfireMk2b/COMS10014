# Workshops

## Overview

Your main learning in this unit will happen in two workshops per week:

  - Tuesday, 2-4 pm.
  - Friday, 2-4 pm.

Attending these workshops is mandatory. 

For each workshop, you will:

  - Before the workshop, prepare yourselves by studying the assigned materials, for example watching videos or reading lecture notes. You are highly recommended to discuss the materials with other students, and to prepare a list of questions of things you want to ask a Teaching Assistant in the workshop.
  - Attend the workshop, where a problem sheet will be handed out that you will work on in a group of around 12 students. Teaching Assistants will be around to help you with any questions you have.
  - After the workshop, individually or with other students, go over anything you don't understand again, write up your own notes, and revise the material. Sample solutions to the problem sheets, as well as the sheets themselves, will appear on this website.

The first workshop will be on Tuesday 6 October at 2pm, and you do not need to prepare anything for this.

## Workshop location

The workshops will be held online using Microsoft Teams. Open [teams.microsoft.com](http://teams.microsoft.com/) in your browser or download the desktop application, and log in with your university e-mail and password. 

  - Click the "Teams" button on the left to show a list of teams you are in.
  - Click the _group COMS10014 Mathematics A_ team.

In the Mathematics A team, there is a _general_ channel where we will share information and problem sheets with you, a _main_ channel where you can ask TAs for help and a number of group channels named after a number and an element of the periodic table e.g. _01 Hydrogen_. In the workshops, you will join the channel for your assigned group of students and solve the problem sheets as a group.

  * For the first 20 minutes or so of each workshop, you will work in your group on the problem sheets.
  * Around 20 minutes after the start of each session, TAs will circulate among the groups. This is your opportunity to ask any questions that you have prepared, and the TAs will ask you questions if you don't have any questions for them. The TAs will also take attendance at this time, so you must be in your assigned group room by this time.
  * Afterwards, the TAs will be in the main channel and if you need any help, you can switch to the main channel and ask a TA to come to your group room and help you.
