# Workshops and Attendance Hurdles

Your main learning on this unit will happen in twice-weekly workshops where you will solve problem sheets in groups with other students. The workshops are timetabled for Monday 1-3pm and Thursday 9-11am in MVB 1.11. There will be 20 workshops in total, two each in weeks 1-5 and 7-11. Week 6 is reading week where there are no timetabled activities, and in Week 12 the workshops are replaced by support sessions for revision week.

We expect you to prepare for each workshop by watching videos and sometimes also reading lecture notes beforehand. In the workshop itself, you will work on a problem sheet, and sample solutions will usually be provided a few days later.

These workshops are **mandatory** and we will take attendance with card readers in each one, so you must bring your UCard along and sign in at the start of each workshop. We expect all students to attend **19 out of 20 workshops**, we do not mind if you miss one in total across the entire unit. 

Support sessions, unlike workshops, are not mandatory (but highly recommended). No attendance is taken in support sessions, and they cannot be used to make up for a missing workshop, not even the Week 12 ones that replace the workshops that week.

If you are unwell for a workshop, you must self-certify your absence with the school. You do not need a doctor's note for this. A self-certified workshop counts the same as an attended one for attendance tracking purposes. If you need to be absent for another reason, ask the school for permission first. 

This unit has an attendance hurdle, as specified in the unit catalogue, that **you must attend at least 75% of all workshops (15 out of 20) otherwise you automatically fail the unit**. Since the hurdle is lower than the 19 workshops we expect you to attend, you will get no sympathy if you attend only 14 and argue that you almost met the hurdle, as you did not come close to the expected 19.

If you have registered a disability with the university, or you have caring responsibilities (for example, you are a parent) then you should talk to the school about possible exceptions from the attendance hurdle.

If you miss more than one workshop without self-certifying, your tutor will be informed, and repeated unexcused absences without good reason may be noted on your student record and lead to further consequences. In extreme cases, a student who is not engaging with their course may be required to withdraw from the university.

Some workshops are in-class tests. For these, you get attendance by completing the test and handing in your answer sheet; it does not matter how well or badly you do on the test as long as you make a reasonable attempt.

_If you are struggling with the unit or the course for any reason, you must inform your personal tutor as soon as possible. On no account should you think "I've fallen behind - so I'll stop going to the workshops"; that leads to falling further behind and usually to failing the year._
