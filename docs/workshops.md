# Workshops

The main learning on this unit will happen in the workshops, held twice a week in most weeks of term, Mondays and Thursdays. In these workshops, you will work in groups which is a good way to meet other students especially at the very start of term. Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be around during the workshops to help your group with any questions that you might have. 
Currently, we plan to hold the workshops on campus, with a parallel online version for students unable to attend in person. 

**Attending the workshops is mandatory**. Mandatory means that for every workshop, you must attend either the on-campus version  or the online one. If you are starting the degree from abroad with permission from the school, or you are in quarantine or self-isolating, or you are otherwise unable to come to the on-campus version of a workshop then you must attend the online version; otherwise it is your choice which version you attend. For attendance purposes both workshops count exactly the same, but we recommend that you attend the on-campus version if you can safely do so as it is easier to explain maths to students when you are in the same room and where we have a whiteboard.

If limits on the number of people or the minimum distance between people mean that we have to restrict attendance at the on-campus workshops, then we will introduce a rota system and you will be told which weeks you are allowed to come to the on-campus workshop. In the other weeks, or any week you cannot or do not want to attend the on-campus workshops, you must attend the online workshops.

## Expectations and Attendance Hurdle

The expectation is that **a properly engaged student will miss at most one workshop in the entire unit without a good reason**. We currently plan on holding two workshops a week for 10 weeks of teaching, so 20 workshops in total of which you are expected to attend 19 to 20. (There are no workshops in Week 6 which is reading week, and in Week 12 where workshops are replaced with optional drop-ins for revision week.)

This unit has an attendance hurdle, as specified in the unit catalogue, that **you must attend at least 75% of all workshops (15 out of 20) otherwise you automatically fail the unit**. Since the hurdle is lower than the 19 to 20 workshops we expect you to attend, you will get no sympathy if you attend only 14 and argue that you almost met the hurdle.

In the on-campus workshops, there will be paper sign-in sheets. In the online workshops, the teaching assistants (TAs) will take attendance. To get attendance recorded in the online version, you must have your microphone and camera on and you must answer the TA if they ask you a question first; if you are logged in but not engaging then this does not count as attendance.

The Friday drop-ins, and the drop-ins that replace the workshops in Week 12, are optional and do not count towards your attendance (you cannot make up for a missed workshop by coming to a drop-in).

Some of the workshops are in-class tests or mock exams. You get attendance for these by taking the test. As long as you make a reasonable effort, even if you do not pass the test then you will still get the attendance for that day. These tests are _formative_, which means the results from these tests are not used for your unit mark, but they do help you to understand your own performance on the unit and give you questions to practice on when you are revising for the real exam in January.

## Exceptions

If you are unwell or unable to attend a workshop at all (even online) for a good reason, then you must self-certify your absence no later than the day of the workshop - you will get information on how to do this from the school, but you can e-mail coms-info@bristol.ac.uk if you are not sure. A workshop that you self-certify for a good reason counts as attended for the purpose of passing the unit, so if a student attends 17 workshops and self-certifies for 2 with a good reason then we count that as attending 19 of 20.

If you miss a workshop without self-certifying, your tutor will be informed and repeated unexcused absences may be noted on your student record and lead to other consequences. In extreme cases, a student who almost never engages with their degree may be asked to withdraw from the university.

If you are struggling with the unit or the course for any reason, you must inform your personal tutor as soon as possible. On no account should you stop going to the workshops because you have fallen behind, because that leads to falling further behind and usually to failing the year.
