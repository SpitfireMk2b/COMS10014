This unit and its companion Mathematics B teach you the basic mathematics that you will need in your Computer Science degree. The topics have been selected based on the needs of units in later years linked to some of our research areas, for example algorithms, machine learning, data science or computational neuroscience as well as topics in statistics that will be of interest to you when you perform experiments or evaluations in your final project or other units later on in your degree.

In 2023-24, the unit will run with in-person lectures and workshops (changed from 2022-23 when lectures were replaced by videos).

All materials that you will need for the unit will be linked to from this page; some links will require you to authenticate with the university's Microsoft Single Sign-On.
