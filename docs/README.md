# COMS10014 Mathematics A

Welcome to the unit website for COMS10014 Mathematics for Computer Science A!

_This page contains information for students starting in the 2021-2022 academic year. If you are a student from the previous year and want to see the old page, please check out the `final-2020-2021` tag from the repository._

This unit and its companion Mathematics B teach you the basic mathematics that you will need in your Computer Science degree. The topics have been selected based on the needs of units in later years linked to some of our research areas, for example algorithms, machine learning, data science or computational neuroscience as well as topics in statistics that will be of interest to you when you perform experiments or evaluations in your final project or other units later on in your degree.

Your unit staff have chosen to make this website for the unit as it is easier to keep information up to date this way. For some things, like watching lecture videos that require you to authenticate with your university account, we will link you back to university systems and you will be asked to authenticate with your university username and password.
