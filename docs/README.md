# COMS10014 Mathematics A

Welcome to the unit website for COMS10014 Mathematics for Computer Science A!

This unit and its companion Mathematics B teach you the basic mathematics that you will need in your Computer Science degree. The topics have been selected based on the needs of units in later years linked to some of our research areas, for example algorithms, machine learning, data science or computational neuroscience as well as topics in statistics that will be of interest to many students when they perform experiments or evaluations in their final project.

The first-year mathematics units are based around four large topic areas:

  * Logic and Proof (Maths A)
  * Combinatorics and Probability (Maths A)
  * Linear Algebra (Maths B)
  * Analysis and Statistics (Maths B)

Logic and proof is, among other things, the mathematics of how computers work - both at the hardware level, where the start of Maths A deliberately overlaps with COMS10015 Computer Architecture to some extent, and at the software level because the modes of thinking here can be used to prove that a program does what it should - or to design a program in the first place.

Combinatorics and Probability is the first step towards the science part of Computer Science - one of the aims of science is to build models that describe parts of the world, even when we do not have complete and accurate knowledge. The material you learn here is also a foundation for machine learning, an area that combines aspects of computing, mathematics and science. When an algorithm "learns" something, there is usually a probability distribution being modelled in the background.

Linear algebra is about vectors, which among other things can be used to describe objects in 2D, 3D or even much higher-dimensional spaces. There are obvious applications to computer graphics and image processing, but linear algebra in one form or another crops up all over Computer Science, whether you expect it or not.

Analysis and Statistics continues the theme of scientific modelling. One particular application is high-performance computing which is used among other things to run simulations of everything from weather and climate models to aerodynamics to social systems to the spread of infectious diseases. The statistics part will help you to produce scientifically valid results: if for one of your projects you take some code and make it run faster, you can now properly evaluate your achievement and compare it to other work in related areas.

## Prerequisites

We require an A* grade in mathematics at A-levels, or an equivalent qualification, to join the Computer Science degree. Obviously, A-levels have been disrupted this year but that does not mean we are going to make you leave with a less valuable degree in three to four years time by "dumbing down" the content of your degree. You have chosen to enrol in one of the better universities in the country and that means we trust you are able to identify by yourself where you have gaps in your previous knowledge, and to deal with this for example by independently teaching yourself missing topics with the help of books in the library or online resources - there are free videos on every part of A-level mathematics.

## Schedule

TODO - awaiting timetabling

The main learning on this unit will happen in two online workshops per week, where you will work in a group using online collaboration software on a problem sheet. Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be around during the workshops to help your group with any questions that you might have.

This unit is designed around _activities_, each of which is built around an online workshop. You will have two activities per week. For each activity, you will:

  1. In your own time, first study the provided materials - usually some combination of videos and lecture notes. We may recommended slots for this in your timetable.
  2. Attend the online workshop by connecting with your computer, laptop or other device via microphone and camera, and work in groups on the problem sheets. We expect you to have studied the provided materials for each activity before the workshop.
  3. After the workshop, work in your own time - this could involve revising, summarising, reading or watching material again that you haven't understood yet, or checking your group's solutions to the problem sheets against the sample solutions.
  4. There will be optional online drop-in sessions each week where you can ask the TAs questions. These take the place of "office hours" as we can have several TAs present in the same session this way.

**Attending the workshops is mandatory**, and part of the TAs' job will be to help with taking attendance in each workshop. This unit has a hurdle, as specified in the unit catalogue, that you must attend 3/4 (75%) of all workshops, otherwise you automatically fail the unit. If you miss a workshop, your tutor will be informed and repeated unexcused absences may be noted on your student record. If you are unable to attend a workshop for good reason, such as illness, then you must self-certify your absence using the university process for this, **before** the start of the workshop. If you are struggling with the unit or the course for any reason, you must inform your personal tutor as soon as possible - on no account should you just stop going to the workshops because you've fallen behind.

Some of the workshops act as in-class tests or mock exams. These are _formative_, which means the results from these tests are not used for your unit mark, but they do help you to understand your own performance on the unit.

The currently planned structure of the activities is as follows, where each row in a table is a pair of activities that could be held in one week. The outline of the weeks is not set in stone yet - we may pause new material for a week during term to hold extra drop-ins and catch-up sessions if necessary.

**Logic and Proof**

| Activity 1 | Activity 2 |
|------------|------------|
| Boolean logic | logic 2 |
| proofs 1 | class test   |
| set theory | predicate logic |
| logic and proof | mock exam |

**Combinatorics and Probability**

| Activity 1 | Activity 2 |
|------------|------------|
| combinatorics | probability |
| conditional probability, Bayes | class test |
| random variables | discrete distributions |
| continuous probability | mock exam |

## Time planning

As a rough guide to time planning:

  1. The average student should spend just over 40 hours a week on average on work related to their course. If you are regularly spending much longer than that in first year and not getting the results you expect, you might want to seek advice on effective learning strategies at university. 
  2. In your first teaching block, you have three units each worth 20 credits. This means on average you will spend just over 13 hours per week on each unit, that is a bit more than a day and a half - although in practice most students will have units that take them shorter or longer than others.
  3. The timetabled _synchronous_ hours - in this unit the workshops, in others maybe labs or problem classes - take up much less time than the 13-ish hours you are supposed to spend on the unit. In a normal year with lectures and labs, the advice to students was to spend at least as much time again on each unit in self-study, as you have in contact hours. This year with lectures replaced by _asynchronous_ material, e.g. you can read or watch it in your own time, your contact time in the workshops and drop-ins will make up only a tiny part of all the work you are expected to do for each unit.

## Contacts

Your main ways of getting help with the unit are:

  1. Ask a TA or staff member during the workshops.
  2. Come to a drop-in session.
  3. Post your question on the online forums for the unit.
  4. Ask other members of your group, or other students that you know.

You must not e-mail unit staff individually with questions about the material, as if we answer in an e-mail then that answer only goes to one student and the others cannot see it, which is unfair. Instead of e-mailing, you should ask questions on the unit forum, where it takes us the same time to reply but the benefit for students is much greater as everyone can read the same explanation.

We do not offer extra private lessons for individual students. However, if you are a student with a registered disability, or from a widening participation background, there may be extra support that you can access through the university.

## Assessment

To pass this unit, you must do two things:

  * Attend at least 75% of all workshops (including class tests and mock exams in workshop slots) in the teaching weeks.
  * Attend and pass the exam in January. The pass mark is 40%, and if you achieve this then your unit mark will be your exam mark.
  
 Attendance does not count towards your grade, but if you do not meet the 75% attendance target then you automatically fail the unit. TAs will be taking attendance in every workshop and it is important that you turn up on time and switch to the correct online "room" for your group; if you are late to a workshop then you must find a TA and make sure that you are recorded. If you are unwell then you must submit a [self-certification for absence form (use the "Engineering Student Forms" link)](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/current-students/) _before the workshop starts_, in which case it will count as attended. If you are unwell for longer than a week, you should see a doctor and get a doctor's note. Since the workshops are online, you are expected to attend even if you are self-isolating or in quarantine, if you are well enough to do so.

The class tests and mock exams in some workshops are formative, that is they are purely for feedback to you and they do not count towards your unit grade. Attending them does count towards your 75% attendance target however.

Drop-in sessions and optional slots in revision weeks are not mandatory and cannot be used to count towards your attendance target.
