# COMS10014 Mathematics A

Welcome to the unit website for COMS10014 Mathematics for Computer Science A!

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">This page currently contains information for the 2020-2021 academic year, as some students still need it for their autumn resits. If you are a new student starting in September 2021, a new page with the correct information for your year group will appear in September.</span>

This unit and its companion Mathematics B teach you the basic mathematics that you will need in your Computer Science degree. The topics have been selected based on the needs of units in later years linked to some of our research areas, for example algorithms, machine learning, data science or computational neuroscience as well as topics in statistics that will be of interest to you when you perform experiments or evaluations in your final project or later units.

Your unit staff have chosen to make a website for the unit as it is easier to keep information up to date this way. For some things, like watching lecture videos that require you to authenticate with your university account, we will link you back to the university's blackboard content management system.
