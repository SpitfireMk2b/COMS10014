# Unit materials and schedule

## Schedule

The currently planned structure of the activities is as follows, but this may change during term if necessary, in which case we will inform all of you and update this page. Workshops for activities marked -- will not take place, and so also do not count towards your 75% attendance hurdle.

Week 12 is in January, before the start of the exam period where you will sit the exam for this unit. Due to limited TA budget this year, it is not clear yet whether we will be able to offer any TA support in the weeks where there are no workshops - TAs are paid by the hour and it would not be fair on them to ask them to support students for extra hours which we cannot pay them for. If there is no TA budget for the remaining weeks, then the best I can offer is that you should support each other. Hopefully, by then you will be on good terms with the rest of your bubble.

The first workshop in Week 1 on Tuesday 6 October will be an introduction workshop - you do not have to prepare anything for this workshop.

After this, please prepare for the workshops as follows:

  * Friday Week 1, 9 October: Watch the video "Logic 1: Introduction to Mathematical Logic" (see the videos section below).
  * Tuesday Week 2, 13 October: Watch the videos titled "Logic 2" (this is one "lecture" but split into several parts).

## Videos

Your lecture videos are hosted on blackboard, the university's content management system.

To access them you must first log in to blackboard at [ole.bris.ac.uk](https://ole.bristol.ac.uk). Then you can use [this link](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_240774_1&content_id=_4562298_1) to view the videos.

If you cannot access the blackboard videos, you must e-mail the school office at coms-info@bristol.ac.uk, not the unit lecturers - lecturers do not have access to the tools to enrol students on units, only the office can do that.

## Workshop rooms

The workshops will be held on Microsoft Teams. Open [teams.microsoft.com](http://teams.microsoft.com/) in your browser or download the desktop application, and log in with your university e-mail and password. 

  - Click the "Teams" button on the left to show a list of teams you are in.
  - Click the _group COMS10014 Mathematics A_ team.

You are reminded that attending the workshops is mandatory.

## Problem sheets

Problem sheets for each workshop session will be handed out in the workshop itself. Afterwards, links to the problem sheets and sample solutions will appear below on this page.
