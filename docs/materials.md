# Unit Materials

_Unit materials will appear here as term progresses._

Files linked to on this page will require you to log in with your university username and password. Just click the link and you will be redirected to a login page, please check it starts with `login.microsoftonline.com`. Never, ever enter your university password on a site without checking first whether it is the real login page or a fake one trying to steal your account (and your maintenance loan) - the real one starts with the address mentioned and your browser must not give any kind of security warning when you are on the page.
