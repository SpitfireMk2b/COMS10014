# Unit materials and schedule

## Materials

Your lecture videos are hosted on blackboard, the university's content management system.

To access them you must first log in to blackboard at [ole.bris.ac.uk](https://ole.bristol.ac.uk). Then you can use [this link](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_240774_1&content_id=_4562298_1) to view the videos.

If you cannot access the blackboard videos, you must e-mail the school office at coms-info@bristol.ac.uk, not the unit lecturers - lecturers do not have access to the tools to enrol students on units, only the office can do that.

Everything else, including worksheets, solutions and PDF versions of the slides, is hosted on the [Teams filestore](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/). It is always safe to use this link - if you are not logged in, then you will get a login page.

## Schedule

The currently planned structure of the activities is as follows, but this may change during term if necessary, in which case we will inform all of you and update this page. In weeks 6 and 11-12 there are currently planned to be no new topics, and unless this plan changes then the workshops in these weeks are not mandatory (and may not take place at all) and do not count towards your 75% attendance hurdle. The mandatory workshops for attendance purposes are weeks 2-5 and 7-10.

For each week, you should watch the videos associated with each workshop before the workshop itself (on Tuesday or Friday). You will then solve the worksheet in groups during the workshop.

_For organisational reasons, we have decided to delay the start of this unit to Week 2 (starting Monday 12 October)._

### Week 1 (Monday 5 October)

Solve the [A-level revision sheet](files/a-level-revision.pdf) on your own. If there is something you do not understand here, revise it in your own time. This week does not count towards your attendance, as there are no workshops.

### Week 2 (Monday 12 October)

Tuesday workshop:

  * Videos: **logic 1** "propositional logic".
  * Worksheet: [logic 1](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/WORKSHEETS/logic-1-WS.pdf).

Friday workshop:

  * Videos: **logic 2** "Boolean algebra".
  * Worksheet: [logic 2](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/WORKSHEETS/logic-2-WS.pdf).

### Week 3 (Monday 19 October)

Tuesday workshop:

  * Videos: **proof 1** "introduction to proof" and **proof 2** "mathematical induction".
  * Worksheet: [proof 1](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/WORKSHEETS/proof-1-WS.pdf).

_There was a technical problem with uploading the induction videos on time. If you did not manage to watch them before the workshop, that is not your fault - please watch them and solve the induction questions on the worksheet in your own time._

Friday workshop:

The worksheet is replaced with a class test. No new videos to watch, but please catch up on mathematical induction if you did not watch it yet. This counts as a normal workshop for attendance purposes.

### Week 4 (Monday 26 October)

Tuesday workshop:

  * Videos: **proof 3** "proof strategies".
  * Worksheet: [proof 2](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/WORKSHEETS/proof-2-WS.pdf) (note, videos and worksheets are not in sync today)

Friday workshop:

  * Videos: **logic 3** "predicate logic".
  * Worksheet: [logic 3](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/WORKSHEETS/logic-3-WS.pdf)

### Week 5 (Monday 2 November)

Tuesday workshop:

  * Videos: **logic 4** "the formal side" and **logic 5** "set theory".
  * Worksheet: [logic and proof](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-COMS10014MathematicsA102/Shared%20Documents/General/WORKSHEETS/logic-and-proof-WS.pdf) (revision worksheet).

Friday workshop:

No new videos. In the workshop, we will hold a mock exam. This counts as a normal workshop for attendance purposes.

### Week 6 (Monday 9 November)

We currently plan to pause teaching in Week 6 and to use it as a revision/catch-up week for you. Details to follow.

Workshops during this week will not be mandatory (and may not exist at all) and will not count towards your attendance target.

### Week 7

* Notes: [probability and combinatorics (pdf)](https://github.com/coms10011/2020_21/raw/master/01_probability/1_probability.pdf)
* Videos:
    * [lecture 1: introducing probability (youtube -  slides)](https://youtu.be/m4VZmCaPg6A)
    * [lecture 2: combinatorics (youtube - slides)](https://youtu.be/NkPpy23FQik)
    * [lecture 3: a quick example from poker (youtube - visualizer)](https://youtu.be/iPRLjaFcmkE)
    * [lecture 4: two more examples (youtube - visualizer)](https://youtu.be/IqtLhm3RLs4)
* Worksheets:
    * [worksheet 1 (pdf)](https://github.com/coms10011/2020_21/raw/master/01_probability/ws1.pdf)
